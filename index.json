Using the Arduino UNO 3, tasks like light control, testing water quality, temperature control, fish feeding, etc., can be automated. Our project has 4 main functionalities; timed fish feeding using a real time clock, temperature monitoring, water level monitoring and light control. There will be a limited remote-control aspect over Wi-Fi, where the Arduino will act as an access point and you can connect to it via an Android app. The app will allow you to remotely turn on lights, instantly feed the fish and set an alarm for the fish feeding mechanism.\nLink to the project\n","date":"11 May 2021","permalink":"/projects/first-post/","section":"","summary":"Smart Aquarium The goal of this project is to make aquarium monitoring and maintenance easier.","title":"Smart Aquarium"},{"content":"About me! # Hi, I am Annsh Agrawaal (Pronounced: Ann-sh), a Software Developer who currently lives in Chicago, IL.
